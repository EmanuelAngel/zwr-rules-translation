            <li>
              Make sure your submission includes all requirements which are
              listed under each specific challenge's rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              As of May 12th 2024, for all flawless submissions, you must
              provide an indication of where your flawless run ends in the
              submission message box as a timestamp.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always double check if you have chosen the right game, map,
              category and challenge, and if all players are listed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every submission must contain full gameplay otherwise it will be
              denied.

              After a game is approved, the footage is expected to stay
              accessible for the record to remain on the leaderboards. If the
              footage ends up missing or private for any reason, that record is
              no longer considered valid and will be removed from the
              leaderboards.

          <p>
            <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: All co-ops <strong>MUST </strong>stream
            their sleepers/breaks to prove the FPS has not been altered.
            Altering the FPS will cause the reset to slow down and therefore is
            <strong>NOT ALLOWED</strong>. We would prefer if all POVs were
            provided however we, at the very least, will require
            <strong>HOST POV.</strong>
